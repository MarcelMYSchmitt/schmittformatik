# Introduction

This project contains all code used for my website https://schmittformatik.de. It's a simple html/php project which also includes javascript and css files.

# About
We have one home start site which is a kind of single page application.  
For the form we use a seperate php send mail script which allows us to send emails to a provided mail adress which is declared in the script.
When the email delivery is successful, you will be redirected to a `thank_you` page. If you forget to add a value in the form you will be redirected to a `error_message` page.
For all other invalid routes you will be redirected to a `404` page.
